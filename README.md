# End-to-End Data Analysis using Python & SQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using **Python and SQL**.  
The goal of the project is to clean raw data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract meaningful insights through structured SQL queries to support data-driven decision making.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relational Database (MySQL )

---

## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends
- Write efficient SQL queries to extract key metrics
- Convert raw data into actionable business insights

---

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Removed duplicate and invalid records
- Performed data type conversions
- Created derived columns for analysis
- Ensured overall data quality and consistency

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distributions and trends in the data
- Identified key performance metrics
- Used grouping and aggregation to uncover insights
- Validated data before SQL-based analysis

---

## SQL Analysis
- Designed and executed complex SQL queries
- Used `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries
- Extracted meaningful insights from relational datasets
- Optimized queries for better readability and performance

---

## Key Insights
- Identified major trends impacting overall performance
- Highlighted high-contributing segments and metrics
- Provided data-backed insights to support decision making
